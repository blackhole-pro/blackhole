# Blackhole Platform - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Introduction

### Product Overview
Blackhole is a decentralized content sharing platform that empowers users with control over their data while enabling engaging social experiences. It combines self-sovereign identity, decentralized storage, and social federation to create a new paradigm for content sharing that balances user sovereignty with service provider innovation.

### Purpose of this Document
This PRD defines the requirements, features, and specifications for the Blackhole platform. It serves as the definitive reference for stakeholders, developers, and product teams working on the platform.

### Target Audience
- **End Users**: Content creators and consumers who want ownership of their data
- **Service Providers**: Organizations building branded experiences on the Blackhole platform
- **Developers**: Technology professionals building on the platform
- **Network Operators**: Entities running Blackhole nodes

## Product Architecture

### Three-Layer Architecture
Blackhole employs a three-layer architecture designed for decentralization:

1. **End Users (Clients)**
   - Lightweight web and mobile applications focused on content consumption and creation
   - Authentication via DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)
   - Simple user interfaces for content interactions
   - No direct P2P responsibilities

2. **Service Providers (Intermediaries)**
   - Organizations building branded experiences on the Blackhole platform
   - Manage user experience and application logic
   - Orchestrate content uploads and retrievals
   - Verify DID-based authentication
   - Issue verifiable credentials
   - Add value-added services on top of core functionality

3. **Blackhole Nodes (Infrastructure)**
   - Decentralized P2P network
   - Handle content processing, storage, and distribution
   - IPFS/Filecoin integration
   - DID registry for decentralized identity
   - Node-to-node communication protocols
   - Content indexing and search
   - Analytics and telemetry collection

### Subprocess Architecture
Blackhole uses a subprocess architecture where services run as independent OS processes:

- **Single Binary Distribution**: One binary to distribute and deploy
- **Service Isolation**: Process crashes don't affect other services
- **Individual Control**: Restart services independently
- **Resource Management**: OS-level CPU, memory, and I/O limits
- **Security Boundaries**: Process-level security isolation

Services communicate via gRPC over Unix sockets locally and TCP for remote communication.

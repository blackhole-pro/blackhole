# Blackhole Implementation Documentation

*Created: May 20, 2025*

This directory contains implementation plans, guidelines, and technical documentation for the Blackhole platform.

## Overview

The implementation documentation provides detailed guidance for developers working on the Blackhole codebase. These documents bridge the gap between the high-level architecture documentation and the actual code implementation.

## Contents

### Core Components

- [01 Core Implementation Plan](./core/01_core_implementation_plan.md) - Overall plan for implementing the core subprocess architecture
- [02 Core Implementation Phases](./core/02_core_implementation_phases.md) - Phased approach with milestones and dependencies
- [03 Process Orchestrator Implementation](./core/03_process_orchestrator_implementation.md) - Detailed implementation plan for the Process Orchestrator component
- [04 Configuration System Implementation](./core/04_configuration_system_implementation.md) - Detailed implementation plan for the Configuration System component

### Development & Deployment

- [Development and Deployment Design](./development_and_deployment_design.md) - Comprehensive guide for development workflow, build system, and deployment patterns

## Purpose

These implementation documents serve several purposes:

1. **Development Guidance** - Provide clear direction for developers implementing components
2. **Technical Reference** - Document implementation decisions and patterns
3. **Onboarding** - Help new developers understand the codebase structure and patterns
4. **Consistency** - Ensure consistent implementation across different components

## Relationship to Architecture Documentation

While the architecture documentation in `/docs/architecture/` provides the high-level design and concepts, the implementation documentation focuses on:

- Concrete code structures and patterns
- Library and dependency choices
- Implementation phases and priorities
- Technical details specific to the Go implementation
- Testing strategies and code organization

## Contributing

When implementing new components or services, consider adding appropriate implementation documentation to this directory to guide current and future developers.

# Blackhole Identity Service Architecture

This directory contains the comprehensive documentation for the Blackhole identity service, which provides self-sovereign identity management capabilities for the platform.

## Overview

The Blackhole identity system is built on three core principles:

1. **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Users control their digital identities through Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
2. **Privacy by Design**: Minimal disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs protect user privacy
3. **Blockchain Integration**: Secure bridging between identity and blockchain functionality

## Architecture Documents

### Core Components

- **[Identity Architecture](core/identity_architecture.md)** - Complete overview of the identity system architecture
- **[DID System](core/did_system.md)** - Decentralized Identifier implementation including resolution and registry

### Protocols

- **[Authentication Protocols](protocols/authentication.md)** - Authentication flows and session management
- **[Credential System](protocols/credentials.md)** - Verifiable credentials issuance, verification, and blockchain anchoring

### Integration

- **[Blockchain Bridge](integration/blockchain_bridge.md)** - Identity-blockchain integration and bridging layer
- **[System Integration](integration/system_integration.md)** - How all identity components work together

### Security

- **[Security Model](security/security_model.md)** - Comprehensive cross-layer security architecture
- **[Signing Architecture](./signing_architecture.md)** - DID signing and wallet operations
- **[ZK Circuit Specifications](./zk_circuit_specifications.md)** - Zero-knowledge proof implementations

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Understanding DIDs**: Start with the [DID System](core/did_system.md) to understand how identities are created and managed
2. **Authentication**: Review [Authentication Protocols](protocols/authentication.md) for login and session flows
3. **Credentials**: Learn about [Verifiable Credentials](protocols/credentials.md) for claims and attestations
4. **Integration**: See [System Integration](integration/system_integration.md) for implementation guidance

## Key Features

### Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
- IPFS-based storage for DID documents
- Integrated registry within P2P nodes
- Support for multiple DID methods
- Cross-method authentication

### Authentication
- Challenge-response protocols
- Multi-factor authentication
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Session management

### Verifiable Credentials
- W3C compliant credential format
- Blockchain anchoring for verification
- Privacy-preserving selective disclosure
- Revocation mechanisms

### Blockchain Integration
- Identity-based asset management
- Credential status on-chain
- Wallet-identity binding
- Cross-layer security

## Implementation Structure

The identity service follows the standard Blackhole package structure:

```
@blackhole/node/
├── services/
│   └── identity/         # P2P node identity services
│       ├── did/          # DID operations and registry
│       ├── credentials/  # Credential verification
│       ├── authentication/ # Auth protocols
│       └── bridge/       # Blockchain integration

@blackhole/client-sdk/
├── services/
│   └── identity/         # Client interfaces
└── platforms/            # Platform-specific implementations

@blackhole/shared/
└── types/
    └── identity/         # Shared type definitions
```

## Security Considerations

All identity operations follow the [Security Model](security/security_model.md) which provides:

- Zero-trust architecture
- Defense in depth
- Identity-centric security
- Cross-layer threat protection
- Privacy preservation

## Standards Compliance

The identity system adheres to:

- W3C DID Specification
- W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect compatibility
- GDPR and privacy regulations

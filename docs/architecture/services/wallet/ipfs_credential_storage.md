# IPFS-Based Credential Storage Architecture

This document describes how the Blackhole wallet system utilizes IPFS for decentralized credential storage, ensuring privacy, security, and user sovereignty.

## Overview

The Blackhole wallet system stores verifiable credentials in IPFS rather than traditional databases. This approach aligns with the platform's decentralized principles and provides several key benefits:

- **User Sovereignty**: Credentials remain under user control
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure for credential storage
- **Immutability**: Credentials cannot be altered once stored
- **Global Accessibility**: Credentials accessible from anywhere via IPFS
- **Privacy**: Encrypted storage with user-controlled access

## IPFS Directory Structure

### Credential Organization

Each user's credentials are organized in a hierarchical IPFS directory structure:

```
/user-did/
├── /credentials/
│   ├── /education/
│   │   ├── university-degree-001
│   │   └── certification-002
│   ├── /identity/
│   │   ├── government-id-001
│   │   └── passport-002
│   ├── /professional/
│   │   ├── employment-001
│   │   └── license-002
│   └── /financial/
│       ├── bank-verification-001
│       └── credit-score-002
├── /presentations/
│   ├── employment-verification-001
│   └── education-proof-002
└── /metadata/
    ├── index.json
    └── access-log.json
```

### Directory Components

**Credentials Directory**:
- Contains all issued credentials
- Organized by credential type
- Each credential stored as encrypted JSON-LD
- Includes proof information and metadata

**Presentations Directory**:
- Stores credential presentations
- Contains selective disclosure proofs
- Maintains presentation history
- Links to source credentials

**Metadata Directory**:
- Index of all credentials
- Access control lists
- Audit logs
- Synchronization state

## Storage Architecture

### Credential Storage Flow

1. **Credential Issuance**:
   - Issuer creates verifiable credential
   - Credential encrypted with user's public key
   - Credential added to IPFS
   - IPFS hash recorded in user's directory

2. **Directory Update**:
   - User's credential directory retrieved
   - New credential reference added
   - Updated directory published to IPFS
   - New root hash becomes user's credential pointer

3. **Access Control**:
   - Credentials encrypted before IPFS storage
   - Decryption keys managed by wallet
   - Sharing creates re-encrypted copies
   - Original credential remains unchanged

### IPFS Content Addressing

**Credential References**:
- Each credential has unique IPFS hash
- Hash serves as immutable reference
- Content integrity automatically verified
- Deduplication happens automatically

**Directory References**:
- Root directory hash represents current state
- Historical versions accessible via previous hashes
- Changes create new root hashes
- State transitions fully auditable

## Encryption and Privacy

### Encryption Layers

**Layer 1: Credential Encryption**:
- Individual credentials encrypted
- User's public key for encryption
- Private key required for decryption
- Support for multiple encryption schemes

**Layer 2: Directory Encryption**:
- Sensitive metadata encrypted
- Index files use searchable encryption
- Access logs protected
- Public metadata remains unencrypted

**Layer 3: Presentation Encryption**:
- Presentations encrypted for recipients
- Time-limited decryption keys
- Automatic expiration
- Revocation capabilities

### Privacy Mechanisms

**Selective Disclosure**:
- Zero-knowledge proofs for attributes
- Minimal credential exposure
- Attribute-specific sharing
- Composite presentations

**Anonymous Credentials**:
- Unlinkable credential usage
- Blind signatures support
- Privacy-preserving verification
- Statistical hiding

## Synchronization and Caching

### Multi-Device Synchronization

**Synchronization Strategy**:
- Latest root hash as synchronization point
- Merkle tree diff for changes
- Conflict resolution via timestamps
- Eventual consistency model

**Device-Specific Caching**:
- Local IPFS node on each device
- Selective credential pinning
- LRU cache for frequently used
- Background synchronization

### Network Optimization

**IPFS Gateway Usage**:
- Public gateways for read access
- Private gateways for secure access
- Gateway load balancing
- Fallback gateway options

**Pinning Services**:
- Distributed pinning across nodes
- Redundant storage locations
- Geographic distribution
- Automatic re-pinning

## Access Control and Sharing

### Permission Management

**Access Control Lists**:
- Stored in metadata directory
- Cryptographic capability tokens
- Time-limited permissions
- Revocable access grants

**Sharing Mechanisms**:
- Direct credential sharing
- Presentation-based sharing
- Proxy re-encryption
- Delegated access

### Audit and Compliance

**Access Logging**:
- Encrypted access logs
- Tamper-evident log chains
- Privacy-preserving analytics
- Compliance reporting

**Regulatory Compliance**:
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Right to erasure support
- Data portability

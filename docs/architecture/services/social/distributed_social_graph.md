# Distributed Social Graph Architecture

## Overview

The Distributed Social Graph service provides a decentralized, scalable, and privacy-preserving social relationship management system. It maintains social connections, interaction patterns, and network effects while ensuring data sovereignty and user control over their social relationships.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Decentralization**: No single point of control for social relationships
2. **Data Sovereignty**: Users own and control their social graph
3. **Privacy by Design**: Granular privacy controls and encryption
4. **Interoperability**: Compatible with various social protocols
5. **Performance**: Fast queries even at massive scale
6. **Resilience**: Fault-tolerant with no single point of failure
7. **Flexibility**: Supports various relationship types and weights

# Moderation and Community Governance

## Overview

Blackhole's moderation and governance system balances user safety with freedom of expression through a decentralized, community-driven approach. This system combines automated tools, human oversight, and democratic governance to create safe and healthy social spaces while respecting user autonomy.

## Core Principles

1. **Community Ownership**: Communities self-govern with minimal platform intervention
2. **Transparency**: All moderation actions and policies are public and auditable
3. **Due Process**: Clear appeals process with fair representation
4. **Decentralization**: No single authority controls content moderation
5. **Context Awareness**: Moderation considers cultural and community context
6. **User Empowerment**: Strong personal filtering and blocking tools
7. **Graduated Response**: Progressive enforcement from warnings to bans

# Revenue Sharing and Royalty Distribution Mechanism

This document outlines the revenue sharing and royalty distribution mechanisms for the Blackhole platform, leveraging Root Network's SFT capabilities to ensure fair compensation for content creators and contributors.

## Overview

The Blackhole revenue and royalty system provides a comprehensive solution for automating content monetization, enabling creators to receive compensation when their content is used, licensed, purchased, or consumed. The system is built on programmable token-level royalty instructions that are enforced at the protocol level.

## Core Principles

The royalty system adheres to these foundational principles:

1. **Creator-First Economics**: Maximizing revenue flow to content creators
2. **Automatic Enforcement**: Royalty distribution happens automatically and cannot be circumvented
3. **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable royalty structures for different content and business models
4. **Transparent Tracking**: All revenue flows are transparent and auditable
5. **Fair Distribution**: Equitable compensation to all contributors based on their contribution
6. **Chain-Level Enforcement**: Royalty logic encoded and enforced at blockchain protocol level

## System Architecture

The royalty system consists of several integrated components:

### 1. Royalty Configuration

Every content token includes a royalty configuration that defines:

- Total royalty percentage (in basis points, where 100 = 1%)
- List of recipients with their respective shares
- Optional secondary sale royalties
- Minimum payment thresholds
- Payment currency preferences

### 2. Revenue Distribution Engine

The distribution engine handles:

- Royalty calculations based on transaction amounts
- Fee splitting according to defined shares
- Automatic payments to designated addresses
- Batched settlements for efficiency
- Handling of edge cases (micropayments, failed transfers)

### 3. Royalty Registry

A system-wide registry that:

- Maintains definitive royalty information for all tokens
- Provides lookup services for marketplace integrations
- Supports royalty configuration updates (if permitted)
- Tracks historical royalty configurations
- Ensures compatibility across different marketplaces

### 4. Payment Tracker

Tracks all royalty-related transactions:

- Records all payments made to royalty recipients
- Maintains payment history for accounting and reporting
- Calculates accumulated earnings for creators
- Notifies recipients of payments
- Generates tax and reporting documentation

## Royalty Models

The platform supports several royalty models to accommodate different content types and business scenarios:

### Primary Sale Royalties

Applied when content is initially sold or licensed:

- One-time payments to creators for initial sales
- Configurable split between multiple contributors

### Secondary Sale Royalties

Applied when content is resold on secondary markets:

- Percentage of each secondary sale goes to original creators
- Enforced automatically by token contracts
- Cannot be removed or circumvented
- Customizable percentage (typically 5-15%)

### Usage-Based Royalties

Applied based on content consumption:

- Per-view/listen/read micropayments

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Music Track with Multiple Contributors

A music track might have a royalty configuration such as:

- Primary artist: 5% (500 basis points)
- Producer: 2.5% (250 basis points)
- Session musicians: 1.5% (150 basis points)
- Label: 1% (100 basis points)

If this track sells for 10 tokens:
- 1 token distributed across recipients according to their shares
- 9 tokens to the seller or platform

### Example 2: Video Content with Tiered Usage

A video might have different royalty structures based on usage:

- Personal viewing: 10% royalty
- Educational use: 8% royalty
- Commercial use: 15% royalty
- Derivative creation: 20% royalty

The system automatically applies the appropriate rate based on the license type purchased.

### Example 3: Collaborative Document with Equal Split

A co-authored document might have:

- Total royalty: 12% (1200 basis points)
- Three authors: 4% each (400 basis points each)

All sales and licensing revenue would be split equally among the three contributors.

## Previous Updates (5/20/2025)

### Implemented Numbered File Sequence
1. ✅ Applied numbered file naming to implementation documents:
   - Renamed core documents to include sequence numbers (01_, 02_, 03_, 04_)
   - Created clear sequence from plan to phases to component implementation
   - Updated implementation README to reflect the numbered files
   - Established pattern for future implementation documents
2. Progress Update:
   - Implementation documents now have clear sequencing

   - Next up: Begin coding the Process Orchestrator following the implementation plan

### Organized Implementation Documentation
1. ✅ Created structured implementation documentation directory:
   - Created `/docs/implementation/core/` subdirectory for core component implementation plans
   - Moved core implementation documents into dedicated directory
   - Added timestamps to all implementation documents for tracking purposes
   - Organized implementation documents by component type
2. Progress Update:
   - Implementation documentation now organized in a logical structure

### Enhanced Implementation Plan with Service Mesh Components
1. ✅ Integrated mesh components (router, eventbus, middleware) into the implementation plan:
   - Added detailed component designs for Router, EventBus, and Middleware
   - Restructured Phase 2 to focus on Service Mesh implementation

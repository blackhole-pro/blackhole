# Blackhole Core Implementation Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

After reviewing the core implementation against PROJECT.md, README.md, architectural foundations, and development guidelines, the current implementation is **well-structured and largely compliant**. However, there are critical import path issues and some cleanup needed.

## Current Status Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Perfect Architecture Alignment**: Implementation follows the documented 5-domain architecture precisely
2. **Clean Domain Separation**: Clear boundaries between Runtime, Framework (Plugins, Mesh, Resources, Economics), and Services
3. **Proper Package Organization**: Components have types/ subdirectories with proper error definitions
4. **Interface-Based Design**: Clean interfaces for cross-package communication
5. **Test Organization**: Tests properly located in /test directory, not alongside code
6. **Build Structure**: Follows documented bin/ directory structure for services

### ❌ Critical Issues
1. **Import Path Errors**: All imports use `core/src/` instead of `core/internal/`
2. **Backup Files**: .bak files need removal
3. **Test Directory Issue**: Malformed `{integration}` directory

## Refactoring Tasks

### Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)

#### 1.1 Fix Import Paths
**Issue**: All import paths incorrectly reference `core/src/` instead of `core/internal/`
**Action**: Update all import statements across the codebase

Files to update:
- `core/internal/core/core.go`
- `core/internal/core/app/app.go`
- `core/internal/runtime/orchestrator/orchestrator.go`
- All other Go files with imports

**Script**: Use `scripts/fix_imports.sh` to automate this process

#### 1.2 Clean Up Backup Files
**Action**: Remove all .bak files
- `core/internal/core/app/application.go.bak`
- `core/internal/core/app/application_adapter.go.bak`

#### 1.3 Fix Test Directory Structure
**Action**: Remove or rename `test/{integration}/` directory

### Priority 2: Framework Enhancement (Next Sprint)

#### 2.1 Complete Plugin Domain Implementation
**Current**: Interfaces defined, implementation pending
**Actions**:
- Implement PluginRegistry for plugin discovery
- Implement PluginLoader for loading/unloading
- Implement PluginExecutor for execution and isolation
- Implement StateManager for hot-swapping support

#### 2.2 Complete Resource Management Domain
**Current**: Framework defined, implementation pending
**Actions**:
- Implement ResourceInventory for discovery
- Implement DistributedScheduler for scheduling
- Implement ResourceMonitor for monitoring
- Implement PerformanceOptimizer

#### 2.3 Complete Economics Domain
**Current**: Framework defined, implementation pending
**Actions**:
- Implement UsageMetering
- Implement PaymentProcessing
- Implement RevenueDistribution
- Implement PricingEngine

### Priority 3: Code Quality Improvements

#### 3.1 Enhanced Error Handling
- Ensure all error types implement proper unwrapping
- Add context to all error returns
- Implement error categorization for better handling

#### 3.2 Logging Standardization
- Ensure all components use structured logging
- Add proper log levels throughout
- Implement log correlation for distributed tracing

#### 3.3 Documentation Updates
- Update inline documentation for all public APIs
- Ensure package comments reflect current implementation
- Add examples for complex interfaces

## Implementation Timeline

- Day 4-5: Run comprehensive tests to ensure fixes work

### Week 2-4: Plugin Domain
- Week 2: Registry and Loader implementation
- Week 3: Executor and isolation implementation
- Week 4: State management and hot-swapping

### Week 5-7: Resource Management Domain
- Week 5: Inventory and monitoring
- Week 6: Scheduler implementation
- Week 7: Optimizer implementation

### Week 8-10: Economics Domain
- Week 8: Metering implementation
- Week 9: Payment processing
- Week 10: Distribution and pricing

## Validation Checklist

### After Each Phase:
- [ ] All tests pass (unit and integration)
- [ ] Import paths are correct
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Interfaces properly defined
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Performance benchmarks pass

## Migration Strategy

### For Import Path Fix:
1. Create fix_imports.sh script
2. Run script on all Go files
3. Run `go mod tidy` to update dependencies
4. Run all tests to verify
5. Update any documentation references

### For New Domain Implementation:
1. Implement interfaces first
2. Create mock implementations for testing
3. Implement core functionality
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Integrate with existing components
6. Update documentation

## Risk Mitigation

### Import Path Changes:
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing after changes

### New Domain Implementation:
- **Risk**: Integration issues with existing components
- **Mitigation**: Interface-first design, extensive integration testing

## Success Criteria

1. All import paths correctly reference `core/internal/`
2. No backup files in repository
3. Clean test directory structure
4. All framework domains have basic implementation
5. Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
6. Documentation reflects implementation

## Conclusion

The current implementation is well-architected and follows the documented design. The main refactoring needed is fixing import paths, which is critical but straightforward. The framework domain implementations can be done incrementally without disrupting the existing structure.

The architecture's clean separation of concerns makes this refactoring low-risk and allows for parallel development of different domains.

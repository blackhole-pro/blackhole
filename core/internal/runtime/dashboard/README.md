## Quick Start

### Option 1: Integrated with Daemon (Recommended)

1. **Start the daemon with integrated dashboard:**
   ```bash
   ./bin/blackhole daemon --foreground
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to http://localhost:8080

3. **Monitor your services:**
   The dashboard will automatically start alongside the daemon and show real-time status of all services.

### Option 2: Standalone Dashboard

1. **Start the dashboard server separately:**
   ```bash
   ./bin/blackhole dashboard
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to http://localhost:8080

3. **Monitor your services:**
   The dashboard will show the current status of all services with auto-refresh enabled.

## Command Line Options

### Daemon with Integrated Dashboard (Recommended)

```bash
./bin/blackhole daemon [flags]

Dashboard-related flags:
  --dashboard               Start web dashboard with daemon (default: true)
  --dashboard-host string   Host for web dashboard (default "localhost")
  --dashboard-port int      Port for web dashboard (default 8080)
  --foreground              Run in foreground (attached to terminal)

## Status Indicators

Services can have the following status values:

- **ðŸŸ¢ Running** - Service is active and healthy
- **ðŸ”´ Stopped** - Service is not running
- **ðŸŸ¡ Error** - Service process exists but has issues
- **âšª Unknown** - Status cannot be determined

## Features in Detail

### Auto-Refresh
- Toggle auto-refresh with the "Enable Auto-Refresh" button
- Updates every 5 seconds when enabled
- Manual refresh available at any time

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Grid layout adapts to screen size
- Touch-friendly controls

### Service Health Detection
The dashboard detects service health by:
1. Checking PID files in the `sockets/` directory
2. Verifying processes are actually running
3. Confirming Unix socket files exist
4. Validating service availability

### Service Control Actions
- **Smart Button States**: Start button disabled when service is running, stop/restart buttons disabled when stopped
- **Loading Indicators**: Buttons show spinning animation during action execution
- **Instant Feedback**: Success/error notifications appear after each action
- **Auto-refresh**: Status automatically updates after service actions complete

### Service Detail Pages
- **Click to Navigate**: Click any service card to open a detailed service page
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: View CPU usage, memory consumption, uptime, and start count
- **Live Log Streaming**: Real-time log entries with level filtering (Error, Warn, Info, Debug)
- **Log Management**: Clear logs, download logs, toggle auto-scroll
- **Quick Actions**: Health checks, configuration viewing, debug restarts
- **Enhanced Controls**: Larger action buttons with advanced service management
- **Configuration Info**: Service type, auto-restart settings, log levels, config files

### Automatic Cleanup
When the daemon is stopped, the system automatically:
- Stops the dashboard server gracefully
- Removes uptime tracking files
- Cleans up stale service PID files
- Ensures no orphaned processes remain

Both `daemon stop` and `daemon-stop` commands perform complete cleanup.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl/Cmd + R** - Manual refresh (overrides browser default)

## File Structure

```
web/dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main dashboard page
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # Responsive CSS styling
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard.js        # JavaScript for real-time updates
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # This documentation
```

## Integration

The dashboard can be integrated with other monitoring tools via the JSON API endpoints:

```bash
# Get service status via curl
curl http://localhost:8080/api/status

# Monitor specific service
curl http://localhost:8080/api/status | jq '.services.identity'

# Check if any services are down
curl http://localhost:8080/api/status | jq '.services | to_entries[] | select(.value.status != "running")'
```

## Development

To modify the dashboard:

1. **HTML**: Edit `web/dashboard/index.html` for structure changes
2. **CSS**: Modify `web/dashboard/styles.css` for styling
3. **JavaScript**: Update `web/dashboard/dashboard.js` for functionality
4. **Backend**: Modify `cmd/blackhole/commands/dashboard.go` for API changes

The dashboard uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript for simplicity and no external dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard won't start
- Ensure port is not in use: `lsof -i :8080`
- Check if you have permission to bind to the port
- Try a different port: `--port 9090`

### Services show as "Unknown"
- Verify services are started: `./bin/blackhole status`
- Check if `sockets/` directory exists
- Ensure PID files are being created correctly

### Auto-refresh not working
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify API endpoint is accessible: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/status`
- Disable browser extensions that might block requests

### Styling issues
- Clear browser cache
- Check if CSS file is loading: view source and click CSS link
- Verify `web/dashboard/styles.css` exists and is readable

## Security Considerations

- Dashboard serves on localhost by default for security
- No authentication is implemented (intended for local development)
- Consider using a reverse proxy with authentication for production
- API endpoints return service information that could be sensitive

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Service log viewing
- Performance metrics and charts
- Authentication and access control
- Historical data and trends
- Service restart capabilities
- Configuration management interface

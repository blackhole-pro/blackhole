# Blackhole Foundation - Architecture Quick Start

## 🏗️ What Is This?

Blackhole Foundation is a **distributed computing framework** built on a **5-domain architecture** that enables:
- **Zero infrastructure costs** through P2P networking
- **Hot-loadable plugins** with fault isolation  
- **User data ownership** vs subscription rental
- **Fair revenue distribution** to contributors

## 📁 Project Structure (5 Minutes to Understand)

### **Vertical Layers**
```
📱 applications/                # User-facing apps (file storage, media streaming, office suite)
🌍 ecosystem/                   # Community, docs, marketplace, governance (Domain 5)
🛠️ core/pkg/                   # Public APIs and developer tools  
🔌 core/internal/framework/    # 4 Core Domains (the heart of the system)
⚙️ core/internal/runtime/      # Process orchestration and system management
🖥️ [OS/Network/Hardware]      # Infrastructure (not our responsibility)
```

### **5 Core Domains**

Each domain is **independent** but **collaborates** through clean interfaces:

#### 1. 🔌 **Plugin Management** (`core/internal/framework/plugins/`)
- **Purpose**: Load, execute, and hot-swap plugins with fault isolation
- **What it does**: Plugin loading, execution, isolation, state management
- **Key files**: `interfaces.go`, `registry/`, `loader/`, `executor/`

#### 2. 🌐 **Mesh Networking** (`core/internal/framework/mesh/`)  
- **Purpose**: Communication and coordination between nodes
- **What it does**: Node discovery, message routing, network topology
- **Key files**: `interfaces.go`, `discovery/`, `routing/`, `transport/`

#### 3. 📊 **Resource Management** (`core/internal/framework/resources/`)
- **Purpose**: Resource allocation, monitoring, and optimization
- **What it does**: Resource scheduling, usage tracking, performance optimization
- **Key files**: `interfaces.go`, `scheduler/`, `monitor/`, `optimizer/`

#### 4. 💰 **Economic System** (`core/internal/framework/economics/`)
- **Purpose**: Payments, revenue distribution, and usage tracking
- **What it does**: Payment processing, cost calculation, revenue sharing
- **Key files**: `interfaces.go`, `metering/`, `payments/`, `distribution/`

#### 5. 🌍 **Ecosystem** (`ecosystem/` and `core/pkg/`)
- **Purpose**: Community, marketplace, docs, SDK, and developer tools
- **What it does**: Community management, plugin marketplace, developer SDK
- **Key locations**: `ecosystem/` (non-code), `core/pkg/sdk/`, `core/pkg/tools/`

## 🚀 For New Developers

### **Quick Orientation**

1. **Read this file** (you're here!) ← 5 minutes
2. **Choose your domain**:
   - Want to work on plugins? → `core/internal/framework/plugins/`
   - Want to work on networking? → `core/internal/framework/mesh/`
   - Want to work on economics? → `core/internal/framework/economics/`
   - Want to build apps? → `applications/`
   - Want to improve developer tools? → `core/pkg/sdk/` or `ecosystem/`
   - Want to work on runtime? → `core/internal/runtime/`

3. **Read domain documentation**: `ecosystem/docs/04_domains/<domain>/README.md`
4. **Look at interfaces**: `core/internal/framework/<domain>/interfaces.go`
5. **Check examples**: `core/examples/<domain>/`
6. **Start contributing**!

### **Development Flow**

```bash
# 1. Understand the architecture
cat ARCHITECTURE_QUICK_START.md

# 2. Build and run
make build
./bin/blackhole status

# 3. Pick a domain and start coding
cd core/internal/framework/plugins/  # or mesh/, resources/, economics/
# Or work on ecosystem:
cd ecosystem/  # for docs, marketplace, community
```

## 🎯 What Makes This Different?

### **Technical Innovation**
- **Hot loading** plugins without downtime
- **Fault isolation** - plugin crashes don't affect core
- **Network transparency** - same API for local/remote execution
- **5-domain separation** - clean architecture that scales

### **Economic Innovation**  
- **User ownership** - you own your data and infrastructure
- **Pay-per-use** - only pay for what you actually consume
- **Fair revenue** - 90% to developers vs 70% on traditional platforms
- **Zero infrastructure costs** - P2P eliminates server bills

## 📋 Current Status

### ✅ **What's Working**
- **Runtime Layer**: Process orchestration and service management
- **Basic Mesh**: P2P networking with libp2p
- **Build System**: Clean compilation and testing
- **Architecture**: Clear domain separation established

### 🚧 **What's In Progress**  
- **Plugin System**: Hot loading and isolation mechanisms
- **Economic System**: Payment processing and revenue distribution
- **Applications**: File storage and media streaming apps

### 📅 **Next Steps**
1. **Plugin System Implementation** (Weeks 1-4)
2. **Economic System Development** (Weeks 5-8)  
3. **First Working Applications** (Weeks 9-12)
4. **Market Validation** (Months 4-6)

## 💡 Key Architectural Principles

### **1. Clean Domain Separation**
- Each domain has **clear responsibilities**
- **No circular dependencies** between domains
- **Well-defined interfaces** for collaboration

### **2. Vertical Layer Organization**
- **Higher layers** can use lower layers
- **Never the reverse** - maintains clean dependencies
- **Each layer** provides abstractions for the layer above

### **3. Independent Evolution**
- **Domains evolve independently** as long as interfaces stay stable
- **Parallel development** across different teams
- **Easy testing** with clear boundaries

### **4. Developer-First Design**
- **Immediate comprehension** - new developers understand quickly
- **Clear contribution paths** - know exactly where to add features
- **Excellent tooling** - everything just works

# 04-mesh: Mesh Networking Domain

## Overview

The Mesh Networking Domain handles communication, discovery, and coordination across all network topologies within the Blackhole Foundation framework.

## Structure

This domain is currently being organized. Documentation will be added here as the mesh networking components are developed.

## Key Components

- **Service Discovery**: Service registration and discovery
- **Request Routing**: Intelligent request routing and load balancing  
- **Network Transport**: Multi-protocol network communication
- **Mesh Topology**: Network topology management and optimization
- **Security Layer**: Encryption, authentication, and authorization

## Coming Soon

- Network topology implementation guides
- Service discovery protocols
- Security model documentation
- Performance optimization guides

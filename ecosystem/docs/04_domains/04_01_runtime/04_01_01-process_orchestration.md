# 01_01: Process Orchestration

## Overview

The Process Orchestration component is the foundation of the Blackhole Runtime Domain, responsible for managing the lifecycle of all subprocess-based services within the framework.

## Architecture

The process orchestrator follows a supervisor pattern with the following key components:

### Core Components

1. **Process Manager**: Handles subprocess spawning and termination
2. **Supervision Tree**: Monitors process health and handles failures
3. **Resource Controller**: Manages CPU, memory, and I/O limits
4. **Communication Bridge**: Facilitates RPC communication between processes

### Process Lifecycle

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   SPAWN     │───▶│   RUNNING   │───▶│  STOPPING   │───▶│  TERMINATED │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
       ▲                  │                                       │
       │                  ▼                                       │
       │           ┌─────────────┐                                │
       └───────────│   FAILED    │◀───────────────────────────────┘
                   └─────────────┘
```

## Implementation

### Process Spawning

The orchestrator spawns processes using the following algorithm:

1. **Prepare Environment**: Set up environment variables and working directory
2. **Apply Resource Limits**: Configure CPU, memory, and I/O constraints
3. **Spawn Process**: Execute the service binary with appropriate arguments
4. **Register Process**: Add to supervision tree and monitoring
5. **Health Check**: Verify successful startup

### Supervision Strategy

The supervisor implements exponential backoff restart logic:

- **Immediate Restart**: For transient failures
- **Delayed Restart**: After repeated failures (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, ...)
- **Circuit Breaker**: Stops restart attempts after threshold

### Resource Management

Each process is allocated resources based on:

- **Service Type**: Identity, storage, networking, etc.
- **Load Requirements**: Expected CPU and memory usage
- **System Capacity**: Available system resources
- **Priority Level**: Critical, normal, or background services

## Configuration

Process orchestration is configured through the main blackhole.yaml:

```yaml
runtime:
  orchestrator:
    max_processes: 50
    restart_policy:
      max_attempts: 5
      backoff_multiplier: 2
      max_backoff: 60s
    resource_limits:
      default_cpu_percent: 10
      default_memory_mb: 512
      default_io_weight: 100
```

## Monitoring

The orchestrator provides detailed metrics on:

- Process count and health status
- Resource utilization per process
- Restart frequency and failure patterns
- Communication latency and throughput

## Integration Points

### With Lifecycle Manager
- Coordinates service startup and shutdown sequences
- Manages dependencies between services

### With Health Monitor
- Receives health check results
- Triggers restarts based on health status

### With Mesh Coordinator
- Registers services with mesh router
- Handles service discovery updates

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Planning**: Allocate appropriate resources based on service requirements
2. **Graceful Shutdown**: Implement proper shutdown handlers in services
3. **Health Checks**: Provide meaningful health check endpoints
4. **Logging**: Use structured logging for debugging and monitoring
5. **Error Handling**: Handle process failures gracefully

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Process Won't Start**: Check executable permissions and dependencies
- **Frequent Restarts**: Investigate service logs for failure causes
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Monitor CPU and memory usage patterns
- **Communication Failures**: Verify RPC endpoint configuration

### Debugging Tools

- Process status commands: `blackhole status`
- Log analysis: `blackhole logs <service>`
- Resource monitoring: `blackhole monitor`
- Health checks: `blackhole health`

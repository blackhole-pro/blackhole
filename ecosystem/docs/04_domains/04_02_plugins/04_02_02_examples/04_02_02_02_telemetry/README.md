# Telemetry Plugin Example

This is an example telemetry plugin that demonstrates real-time operational monitoring, health tracking, and incident response capabilities within the Blackhole Foundation framework.

## Purpose

This telemetry plugin enables:
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live system health and performance tracking
- **Incident Response**: Automatic detection and response to system issues
- **Operational Insights**: Understanding system behavior and performance patterns
- **Capacity Management**: Resource utilization and scaling recommendations

## Architecture Documents

- **[telemetry_architecture.md](./telemetry_architecture.md)** - Real-time operational monitoring plugin architecture

## Key Components

### Health Monitoring
- Framework component health tracking
- Plugin health and lifecycle monitoring
- Network connectivity and performance
- Resource utilization monitoring

### Alerting System
- Real-time alert generation
- Alert routing and escalation
- Incident correlation and deduplication
- Communication with external systems

### Performance Tracking
- Latency and throughput monitoring
- Resource efficiency measurement
- System bottleneck identification
- Performance trend analysis

## Separation from Analytics Plugin

While related, Telemetry and Analytics plugins serve different purposes:

**Telemetry Plugin (Operational)**:
- Real-time system health
- Immediate incident response
- Operational metrics
- System availability

**Analytics Plugin (Business Intelligence)**:
- Historical data analysis
- Business insights
- Usage patterns
- Economic modeling

## Plugin Integration

### With Framework Domains
- **Runtime Domain**: Monitors core system health
- **Plugin Management**: Tracks plugin lifecycle and health
- **Mesh Networking**: Monitors network performance and connectivity
- **Resource Management**: Provides resource utilization data

### External Systems
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- AlertManager for alert routing
- PagerDuty/Slack for incident response

## Plugin Implementation

This telemetry plugin demonstrates:
- **Hot Loading**: Can be loaded/unloaded without framework downtime
- **Fault Isolation**: Runs in separate process, crashes don't affect framework
- **Network Transparency**: Can monitor distributed system components
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency monitoring and alerting

## Implementation Status

ðŸ†• **Example Plugin**: Architecture design for demonstration and reference
ðŸ”„ **Basic Implementation**: Health monitoring exists in Runtime Domain
ðŸ”„ **Full Plugin**: Planned as standalone plugin in plugin ecosystem

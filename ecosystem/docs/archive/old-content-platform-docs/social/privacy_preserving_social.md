# Privacy-Preserving Social Features

## Overview

This document outlines the privacy-preserving technologies and techniques implemented in Blackhole's social services. Our approach ensures users can enjoy rich social interactions while maintaining complete control over their personal data and social relationships.

## Privacy Design Principles

1. **Data Minimization**: Collect only essential data required for functionality
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
3. **User Control**: Full user control over data collection and usage
4. **Transparency**: Clear explanation of data practices
5. **Security by Design**: Encryption and protection at every layer
6. **Decentralization**: No central repository of social data
7. **Anonymity Options**: Support for pseudonymous interactions

# Federated Social Network Architecture

## Overview

Blackhole's federated social network architecture enables decentralized social interactions across multiple instances while maintaining user autonomy and data sovereignty. Built on ActivityPub and other open protocols, this architecture supports seamless communication between diverse platforms and communities.

## Federation Principles

1. **Decentralization**: No central authority controls the network
2. **Interoperability**: Compatible with existing federated platforms
3. **User Agency**: Users choose their home instance and data policies
4. **Protocol Agnostic**: Support for multiple federation protocols
5. **Privacy First**: Encryption and privacy controls across federation
6. **Community Autonomy**: Each instance maintains its own rules
7. **Resilience**: Network continues functioning despite instance failures

# Content Licensing and Rights Management Using SFT

This document outlines the content licensing and rights management system for the Blackhole platform, leveraging Root Network's Semi-Fungible Token (SFT) capabilities to create a flexible, enforceable rights framework for digital content.

## Overview

The Blackhole licensing and rights management system enables fine-grained control over how content can be used, shared, and monetized. By encoding licensing terms directly into tokens, the platform creates a self-enforcing rights management framework that balances creator control with user-friendly access to content.

## Core Principles

The rights management system is built on these foundational principles:

1. **Creator Control**: Giving content creators full authority over their content's usage terms
2. **Transparent Terms**: Clearly communicating rights and restrictions to content consumers
3. **Automated Enforcement**: Programmatically enforcing licensing terms at the protocol level
4. **Flexible Licensing**: Supporting diverse licensing models to meet different creator needs
5. **Verifiable Compliance**: Enabling easy verification of proper licensing
6. **Rights Portability**: Allowing licensed content usage across different applications

## System Architecture

# Original instruction

List all documents in docs. Iteratively repeat below process for each file.
1. Create list of tasks with complete details as per Atlas schema.
2. Make sure to assign priority, dependencies and appropriate tags.
3. Save each task into Atlas.
4. Create and assign relevant knowledge to each task.
5. Make sure again each task dependencies is defined to relevant previously created tasks.
6. Create 5 sub-tasks for each tasks and repeat this process again for two more rounds.
7. Make sure to assign priority, dependencies and appropriate tags.
8. Create and assign relevant knowledge to each task.

Always read the task-creation-reference.md document and also read the document you are working on in full before continue. Focus to complete all tasks, sub-tasks (round 1), sub-tasks (round 2) and assign relevant knowledge first before moving on to another documents. Do update progress into the document periodically.

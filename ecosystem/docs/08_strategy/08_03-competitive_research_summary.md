    pluginID, fromVersion, toVersion string,
) error {
    // Create distributed checkpoint
    checkpoint := dsm.checkpointManager.CreateCheckpoint(pluginID)
    
    // Migrate state across all instances
    migrator := dsm.migrationHandlers[pluginID]
    newState := migrator.Migrate(checkpoint.State, fromVersion, toVersion)
    
    // Atomically switch to new version
    return dsm.versionManager.AtomicSwitch(pluginID, newState, toVersion)
}
```

## Economic Disruption Analysis

### Traditional Platform Economics vs Blackhole Model

#### **Current Extraction Model:**
```
Platform Revenue = User Payments - Infrastructure Costs - Development Costs
Developer Revenue = 70% of sales (after 30% platform fee)
User Cost = Full subscription price regardless of usage
Data Ownership = Platform retains all user data
```

#### **Blackhole Distribution Model:**
```
Network Revenue = 10% of transactions (vs 30% platform fee)
Developer Revenue = 90% of sales (vs 70% traditional)
User Cost = Pay-per-use (90% reduction vs subscriptions)
Data Ownership = Users retain complete data ownership
```

### Market Disruption Potential

**Subscription Economy Vulnerability:**
- **Total Market**: $650B annual subscription revenue
- **User Pain Point**: Average $1,400/year per household in subscription fees
- **Platform Dependency**: Users rent access rather than own data
- **Developer Exploitation**: 30% platform fees reduce innovation incentives

**Blackhole Economic Alternative:**
- **Cost Reduction**: 90%+ savings vs traditional subscription model
- **Ownership Model**: Users own data and infrastructure vs renting access
- **Fair Distribution**: Revenue flows to contributors vs platform extraction
- **Innovation Incentives**: Higher developer revenue share drives ecosystem growth
